### Author's Note :
Writing my own automation bot and tools provided me as much fun as playing the game itself, and even more actually.
Another reason to encourage players to build their own softwares is the maintenance issues.
Tools have to be updated each time a major change occurs in the game.
Furthermore, firestone tools can't survive long time after their authors quit the game.
